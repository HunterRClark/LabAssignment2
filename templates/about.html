            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Hunter R. Clark, an Aviation Programs Manager and Navy Veteran with an active Secret Security Clearance. With over 5 years of proven experience in training and procedures standardization for rotary wing operations, I have successfully managed and trained cross-functional teams of up to 30 diverse personnel.

                My expertise extends to administrative processes, safety procedures, and regulations compliance, all while leveraging strong time management skills to complete high-risk tasks with meticulous attention to detail in fast-paced environments.
                
                During my military career, I played a crucial role in facilitating professional development training for qualifications/certifications, syllabus creation, and technology integration, all of which were vital to conducting domestic operations crucial to national security.
                
                One of my key accomplishments includes managing risk across multiple lines to protect assets, property, and equipment valued over $28 million, all while meeting the expectations of senior leadership.
                
                My educational background includes earning a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in under 2 years at Boise State University with a GPA of 3.5. In addition to my academic achievements, I hold certifications in Seahawk Weapons and Tactics Instruction, Small Arms Instruction, Helicopter Aerial Door Gunner Instruction, NVD Form Crewman, Night Systems Instruction, and CRM Instruction.
                
                With a strong foundation in mathematics and hands-on experience in aviation operations, I am well-equipped to excel in challenging roles that require analytical thinking, leadership, and operational expertise.</p>
